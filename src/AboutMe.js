          <p>
            I'm a Computer Science graduate with a Master's Degree from ETH ZÃ¼rich. 
            My journey began with a fascination for the complexities of the human brain. 
            Today, I am convinced that the human brain is much more complex, and focus on understanding peoples
            needs and requirements and transform them into software solutions.
