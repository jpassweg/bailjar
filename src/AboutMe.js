          <p>
          I'm a Computer Science graduate with a Master's Degree from ETH ZÃ¼rich. 
          My journey began with a fascination for the consciousness created by the human brain and finding similarities to machines. 
          Today, I am convinced that the human brain is too complex for me to fully understand. 
          Instead, I focus on understanding people's needs and requirements and transforming those into software solutions.
